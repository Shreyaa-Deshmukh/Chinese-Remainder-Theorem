# Chinese-Remainder-Theorem
Python implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for solving systems of modular congruences.
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), a number theory algorithm used to find a solution to systems of simultaneous modular congruences.
The code supports both pairwise coprime and generalized modulus cases, making it useful for cryptography, modular arithmetic problems, competitive programming, and educational demonstrations.
